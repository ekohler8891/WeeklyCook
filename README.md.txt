The application is focusing on the problem of picking meals to cook this week.

In future phases the features will grow and one of the ultimate goals will be able to have the week's grocery list as a result of using this application with the knowledge ahead of time what will be left over.

We are currently on Phase 1 which its goal is start the project on simple user interface with no database but rather a list of receipes that is hardcoded in.

Later updates will include a database that will expand based on the user adding more receipes that could be printed out to be shared or added to others using the application to help them meal plan for the week.
